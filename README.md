## Issues(Bugs)
- Killsay crashes the game


## Guide:
- !!!!THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY FEDORAWARE LEGACY!!!! We suggest using [Fedoraloader](https://github.com/lnx00/Fedoraloader/releases/) as it downloads the latest build and injects it with minimal crashing. It also includes VAC Bypass
- Alternatively, use an injector like [Xenos](https://github.com/relaxtakenotes/xenos) to inject the dll into TF2. [(Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT3kVA053IY)
- __If you have any problems, you can leave them - [Issues](https://github.com/MCPEnguXD/FedorawareLegacy/issues)__ (Dear god please link a config and follow the issue template)
